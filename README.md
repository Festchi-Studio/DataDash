# My Dashboard

This is a simple static dashboard that uses HTML, CSS and Chart.js.

## Files
- `index.html` — the dashboard page (open this in the browser).
- `README.md` — this file.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a **new repository** on GitHub called `my-dashboard`.
2. Add the files (`index.html` and `README.md`) to the repository (web upload or push via Git).
3. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages** and set the source to the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.
4. Visit `https://your-username.github.io/my-dashboard/` (replace `your-username`).
